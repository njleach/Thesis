\chapter{\label{ch1}Conventional probabilistic attribution} 

Here I present a probabilistic extreme event attribution of the 2018 European heatwave. Whilst demonstrating the methodologies behind this framework, I examine how one particular aspect of probablistic event attribution -- the definition of the event -- projects strongly onto the quantitative results. In the closing remarks, I reflect on potential issues with the approach taken within the chapter, and suggest ways in which these could be overcome.
