% I've (John) tried to comment this file extensively, so read through it to see how to use the various options.  Remember
% that in LaTeX, any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.


%%%%% CHOOSE PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one will format for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{ociamthesis}
% This one will format for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one will format for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper,nobind]{ociamthesis} 


%%%%% GENERIC TEXT
\usepackage{blindtext}


%%%%% SELECT YOUR DRAFT OPTIONS
% Three options going on here; use in any combination.  But remember to turn the first two off before
% generating a PDF to send to the printer!

% This adds a "DRAFT" footer to every normal page.  (The first page of each chapter is not a "normal" page.)
\fancyfoot[C]{\emph{DRAFT Printed on \today}}  

% This highlights (in blue) corrections marked with (for words) \mccorrect{blah} or (for whole
% paragraphs) \begin{mccorrection} . . . \end{mccorrection}.  This can be useful for sending a PDF of
% your corrected thesis to your examiners for review.  Turn it off, and the blue disappears.
\correctionstrue


%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
% Note that your bibliography will require some tweaking depending on your department, preferred format, etc.
% The options included below are just very basic "sciencey" and "humanitiesey" options to get started.
% If you've not used LaTeX before, I recommend reading a little about biblatex/biber and getting started with it.
% If you're already a LaTeX pro and are used to natbib or something, modify as necessary.
% Either way, you'll have to choose and configure an appropriate bibliography format...

% The science-type option: numerical in-text citation with references in order of appearance.
\usepackage[style=phys, sorting=none, backend=biber, doi=false, isbn=false, natbib=true, citestyle=science, backref=true]{biblatex}
\newcommand*{\bibtitle}{References}
% defines the backreferencing string in the bibliography
\DefineBibliographyStrings{english}{%
  backrefpage = {p.},%
  backrefpages = {pp.}%
}

% The humanities-type option: author-year in-text citation with an alphabetical works cited.
%\usepackage[style=authoryear, sorting=nyt, backend=biber, maxcitenames=2, useprefix, doi=false, isbn=false]{biblatex}
%\newcommand*{\bibtitle}{Works Cited}

% This makes the bibliography left-aligned (not 'justified') and slightly smaller font.
\renewcommand*{\bibfont}{\raggedright\small}

% Change this to the name of your .bib file (usually exported from a citation manager like Zotero or EndNote).
\addbibresource{Introduction/Thesis-Introduction.bib}
\addbibresource{Ch2/Thesis-Ch2.bib}
\addbibresource{Ch3/Thesis-Ch3.bib}
\addbibresource{Ch4/Thesis-Ch4.bib}
\addbibresource{Ch5/Thesis-Ch5.bib}
\addbibresource{Discussion/Thesis-Discussion.bib}

% NJL: tidy up bibliography & allow custom notes (through the Zotero "note" interface) to be printed after entries

% NJL: these lines remove unwanted fields from the printed biliography
\AtEveryBibitem{\clearfield{issn}}
\AtEveryBibitem{\clearlist{issn}}
\AtEveryBibitem{\clearfield{language}}
\AtEveryBibitem{\clearlist{language}}
\AtEveryBibitem{\clearfield{note}}
\AtEveryBibitem{\clearlist{note}}

% NJL: adds in the annotation field
\DeclareFieldFormat{annotation}{\textbf{#1}}
\AtEveryBibitem{
\csappto{blx@bbx@\thefield{entrytype}}{\iffieldundef{annotation}{}{\par\printfield{annotation}}}
}

% Uncomment this if you want equation numbers per section (2.3.12), instead of per chapter (2.18):
%\numberwithin{equation}{subsection}



%%%%% THESIS / TITLE PAGE INFORMATION
% Everybody needs to complete the following:
\title{Reliable attribution and projection of extreme heat events altered by human influence on the climate}
\author{Nicholas J. Leach}
\college{St. Cross College}

% Master's candidates who require the alternate title page (with candidate number and word count)
% must also un-comment and complete the following three lines:
%\masterssubmissiontrue
%\candidateno{933516}
%\wordcount{28,815}

% Uncomment the following line if your degree also includes exams (eg most masters):
%\renewcommand{\submittedtext}{Submitted in partial completion of the}
% Your full degree name.  (But remember that DPhils aren't "in" anything.  They're just DPhils.)
\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
% Term and year of submission, or date if your board requires (eg most masters)
\degreedate{Trinity 2022}

% Supervisors
\supervisorone{Antje Weisheimer}
\supervisortwo{Myles R. Allen}

%%%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS
% This is a good place to dump your own LaTeX macros as they come up.

% To make text superscripts shortcuts
	\renewcommand{\th}{\textsuperscript{th}} % ex: I won 4\th place
	\newcommand{\nd}{\textsuperscript{nd}}
	\renewcommand{\st}{\textsuperscript{st}}
	\newcommand{\rd}{\textsuperscript{rd}}

% NJL: to format chapter references nicely
\usepackage{etoolbox}
\newcommand{\formatchref}[8]{%
	\noindent #1 %
	(#2). %
	\textbf{#3}. %
	\emph{#4}, %
	\ifstrempty{#5}{}{\textbf{#5}}%
	\ifstrempty{#6}{}{(#6)}%
	\ifstrempty{#7}{}{, #7}. %
	\ifstrempty{#8}{}{\url{#8}}%
	}

% NJL: to use tt font for urls
\urlstyle{tt}

% NJL: try to change spacing (works but messes up frontmatter)
\usepackage[]{setspace}
% \onehalfspacing

% NJL change font of "Appendices" title
% \let\appendixpagenameorig\appendixpagename
% \renewcommand{\appendixpagename}{\rmfamily\appendixpagenameorig}

% NJL: add in listings package for code snippets
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{language=Python}

%%%%% THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE
\begin{document}


%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{17pt plus1pt minus1pt}

% Leave this line alone; it gets things started for the real document.
\setlength{\baselineskip}{\textbaselineskip}


%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}


%%%%% ABSTRACT SEPARATE
% This is used to create the separate, one-page abstract that you are required to hand into the Exam
% Schools.  You can comment it out to generate a PDF for printing or whatnot.
\begin{abstractseparate}
	\input{Abstract/abstract} % Create an abstract.tex file in the 'text' folder for your abstract.
\end{abstractseparate}


% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC.  This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.
\begin{romanpages}

% Title page is created here
\maketitle

%%%%% DEDICATION -- If you'd like one, un-comment the following.
%\begin{dedication}
%This thesis is dedicated to\\
%someone\\
%for some special reason\\
%\end{dedication}

%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{acknowledgements}
 	\input{ancil/acknowledgements}
\end{acknowledgements}

%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{abstract}
	\input{Abstract/abstract}
\end{abstract}

%%%%% MINI TABLES
% This lays the groundwork for per-chapter, mini tables of contents.  Comment the following line
% (and remove \minitoc from the chapter files) if you don't want this.  Un-comment either of the
% next two lines if you want a per-chapter list of figures or tables.
\dominitoc % include a mini table of contents
%\dominilof  % include a mini list of figures
%\dominilot  % include a mini list of tables

% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page.  It generally makes things look better.
\flushbottom

% This is where the whole-document ToC appears:
\tableofcontents

\listoffigures
	\mtcaddchapter
% \mtcaddchapter is needed when adding a non-chapter (but chapter-like) entity to avoid confusing minitoc

% Uncomment to generate a list of tables:
%\listoftables
%	\mtcaddchapter

%%%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS
% This example includes a list of abbreviations.  Look at text/abbreviations.tex to see how that file is
% formatted.  The template can handle any kind of list though, so this might be a good place for a
% glossary, etc.
\include{ancil/abbreviations}

% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
\end{romanpages}

% NJL: this sets the spacing in the main text
% \onehalfspacing
\doublespacing

%%%%% CHAPTERS
% Add or remove any chapters you'd like here, by file name (excluding '.tex'):
\flushbottom
\include{Introduction/Introduction}

\include{Ch2/Ch2}

\include{Ch3/Ch3}

\include{Ch4/Ch4}

\include{Ch5/Ch5}

\include{Discussion/Discussion}


%% APPENDICES %% 
% Starts lettered appendices, adds a heading in table of contents, and adds a
%    page that just says "Appendices" to signal the end of your main text.
\startappendices
% Add or remove any appendices you'd like here:
\include{Appendices/A1}


%%%%% REFERENCES

% JEM: Quote for the top of references (just like a chapter quote if you're using them).  Comment to skip.
\begin{savequote}[8cm]
  Quote
  \qauthor{--- author}
\end{savequote}

% NJL: this sets the spacing since baselineskip commands don't seem to work...
\singlespacing

\setlength{\baselineskip}{0pt} % JEM: Single-space References

{\renewcommand*\MakeUppercase[1]{#1}%
\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc,title={\bibtitle}]}
