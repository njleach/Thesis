\chapter{\label{intro}Introduction} 

In this chapter I introduce the problem of attribution of individual extreme weather events to anthropogenic climate change. I review the current methodologies and frameworks that address this problem, in particular the contrasting storyline and probabilistic approaches to attribution. Although these frameworks are gaining acceptance and maturity, I suggest that a weather forecast-based approach could further increase the trustworthiness of attribution studies. Finally, I provide a conceptual sketch of these various attribution frameworks within a simple non-linear dynamical system.
